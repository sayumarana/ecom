## MOTHER HEALS HERB SHOP
    This app was created for my local herb shop to have a platform for anxious customers to order highly sought after herbal remedies. This app is meant to be user friendly with a clear path on how to get from one page to another. This is a 3 page app so that the users do not get lost when they are there to either get more information on the bussiness or to purchase a product.

## MOTIVATION
     My passion for holistic health and technology has lead me to create this project. Throughout the process of creating this project I kept in mind my target audience which is health conscious milineals. My appreciation for minimalistic art shined through on my project; it meant to have an artistic minimal design that grabs your attention.


## BUILT USING REACT, NODE.JS , BOOTSTRAP, EXPRESS
## FEAUTURE
    This app is a one stop shop to learn about a variety of herbs, how they effect the body, the most effective ways to start implementing them into your diet, and an area to shop for herbs. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
